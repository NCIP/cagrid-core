[RECIPE]
Your organization should be caGrid, your module should be your project name (e.g projects/<projectname>)

define all public confs, extending eachother as appropriate
define publications against the public confs, leveraging the extends
make private conf which extends all public confs
define deps according to which public confs need them; and the rest to the private conf

retrieve against the private conf

can make additional finer-grain private confs as necessary (such as to seperate test libs)


[NOTES]
I've removed/commented out dependencies that come, or are compatible, with globus... should probably have specific confs (e.g. "gt4-deps" instead)

* Look into Eclipse + IvyDE, and use of ability to generate .classpaths 
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde/cp_container.html

* Look at using ivy:install to build the "public" repository

* Now that we are using beta 1, we can use ivy:makepom to generate maven2 poms
  - needs to run against generated repo, so it uses resolved ivy files
  - then need to be able to publish to maven2 like repo 

* how should we deal with GLOBUS_LOCATION?
currently leaving as is... we should take this as an opp to move away from relying on it

* should just move to using "lib" dir for externals and get rid of "ext", and not have any project have local jars
  - only reason not to, is we are putting more than just "libs" in the dir

* how to deal with caGrid versions?
currently having each project do it
 
* we can do stuff like this for schemas (to not put versions on them):
        <ivy:retrieve pattern="${resolved.artifacts.dir}/[conf]/[type]s/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]" type="jar"/>
        <ivy:retrieve pattern="${resolved.artifacts.dir}/[conf]/[type]s/[artifact].[ext]" type="xsd"/>
