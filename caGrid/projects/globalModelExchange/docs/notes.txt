XML Representations of Schemas

A schema is represented in XML by one or more schema document, 
that is, one or more [schema] element information items. 

A schema document contains representations for a collection of schema components, 
e.g. type definitions and element declarations, which have a common [target namespace]. 

A schema document which has one or more [import] element information items corresponds to 
a schema with components with more than one [target namespace], see [Import Constraints and Semantics].



















AMR00
namespaced entity


includes processed within a namespace (can't upload a schema with out its includes)

schema upload/download needs to be done as a tree structure
  -imports done against the system id of the root of the tree


namespace
  -system id (unique within a namespace)
  
  
  
  
  
system id used as default name when written to filesystem 



AMR01
last modified for each schema
be able to ask for it (so client can determine if they have newest version when working with dev versions)
need aggregate modified calculated from schema and all of its namespaces



AMR02
schemas are processed by all schemas in namespace

if existing schema includes are in database, if namespace is updated, all includes need to be resolved against
schema in submission set; can't mix and match with includes in database and includes in submission set

AMR03
userinformation provider (springized into GME)
  getUserIdentity
implement with gt4provider to extract identity

AMR04
consider not doing database deletes, but rather keeping status (deleted, obsolete, active, etc).
would allow to keep history

AMR05
store annotations (namespace, name, value) and a source (<system> or identity)
create metadata profile (iso, dublin core), which creates annotations.
a profile is instantiated with the typed values and submitted as a number of annotations to a well-known namespace (and names) 

AMR06
can we create persistible subclasses of domain objects (e.g PersistibleXMLSchema extends XMLSchema)
base class (XMLSchema) is in common and used over the grid, persistible class is in server package and not serializable and is what is stored in the db
the persistible classes would have more convenience operations (eg. getAnnotations(), getDependingSchemas()) rather than keeping all the features decoupled in the domain (for serialization and reusablility purposes)
