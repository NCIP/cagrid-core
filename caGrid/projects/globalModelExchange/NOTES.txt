=================================================================================
Overview:
=================================================================================
GME Client (uses domain)

GME Service (uses domain)
GME (uses some of domain)
-----transactional boundary-----
  -schema loader (Sax Parser; uses SP layer to extract published information)
  --SchemaPersistence Layer (interface)
     (hibernate implementation), (in memory implementation), 


=================================================================================
Features/Issues:
=================================================================================
[DONE]if we add more deploy configurable things (policy, security, persistence, etc), we may want
to just use spring to initialize some GME configuration file, and make the spring conf the only
deploy configuration (the serviceimpl would use spring to init the GME) 

could/should make authorization enforcement a deploytime interface
could make default be grouper-based and be managed by a sibling service
  -could make as a service context of GME, but I'd like to keep them decoupled
  -basically would write permissions to local DB, which GME authz impl would lookup

I'd like to keep as much "policy" out of the GME implementation as possible,
but provide a policy interface to allow the enforcement of local policy.
  - For example:
		-Whether or not to allow deletion of a published schema should
    	 be a policy decision.
    	-Should be able to reject a specific schema submission for policy reasons
    	 (e.g. doesn't meet some namespace constraints or other "quality" check)
  - The GME itself should really only enforce "global soundness"
  - Other policy should be optionally plugged in (at deploytime) 
  - Should support policy chaining

Should we capture and make available (non-fatal) "schema warnings"?
  - for example, importing a non-existent schema and not using it is not a fatal error, only a warning
  - this information should be passed to policy interface 

make a utility for validating an XML document against the GME:
- will need an entity resolver that talks to GME to get XSDs
- could run as client util, or make a validate(xml) service operation

how do we want to treat XML schema namespace?
  - GME should have it in the DB and support retrieval of it
  - which namespace do we use (just the latest)?
  - do we prevent modification/deletion/etc of it (even for super users)?
  - i think we should go ahead and upload the last few that are commonly used.

do we need to do anything for xsi stuff.. like xsi:schemaLocation?
  - this may link to a file location or http:// etc, we probably don't want
    XSDs coming out of the GME with that stuff in it
  - not sure if XSOM processes it, but other processors will and may cause 
    unexpected behaviors (like pulling an XSD from some non-GME location)
  - we should not enable schemaLocation to be used because it is not ever 
  	guaranteed to work, even if a document comes from a web location.

need to be sure to require use of targetNamespace, even though XSOM may not

[DONE]we *could* support schema "includes" now
  - this is fairly common in existing large schemas
  - i don't see any real problems with this but we may want to support multiple schema
    texts with this and this will require some more thought on the database

Do we want to do anything special with xsd:redefine?
  - seems potentially dangerous in a environment buying into GME, but its impact
    is localized to those using the XSD that does the redefine
  - really no technical reason to not allow it; just policy 
  - it enables the creation of a complete mess, i am not convinced it is useful but 
    maybe we should not prevent it in case we are not aware of some special 
    use cases.
    
probably should allow even published/deprecated schemas to be removed
  - should have a "forceDelete" option in protocol to indicate to try this
  - should require "superuser" privileges
  - only reason for not doing so now is policy (no technical reason not to as 
    long as we make sure it doesn't leave dangling references)
      - in the distributed version, there was no way to check this
  - because we are not making this distributed we can support this, we can even
    be sure to only do it if there is no one referencing it and warn if there is

[DONE]need to work out algorithm for submission (depends on how we impl the db layer):
-see GME_submission.doc in docs dir
   
could support a GME "Context" as a basic container for everything
  - all namespaces/XSD/etc would be associated with a Context
  - things would only need to be unique within a context
  - basically each context would act like its own GME
  - would let us run things like a "development/testing/staging" context in the same GME
    instead of requiring a completely separate service to be stood up
  - CONS: complicates protocol/API, queries probably less effcient 
  - i am not for this becuase i don't want to promote overlaping namespace domains
  - it will enable people to avoid namespace collisions by creating a new context
  - i think it would be used for the wrong reasons

what query styles to we want to support?  may effect what XSOM information we store
- regex on the namespace
- free text on the schema
- look into supporting xpointer for pointing inside schemas:
    - e.g. #xpointer(xs:schema/xs:element[@name="person"]) 
    - this is probably more appropriate http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-ref/

consistent with the schema specification, the GME server ignores schemaLocation "hints" and
resolves schema references via its rules.  To address potential issues with using the 
schemas outside of the context of the GME, the client API has utilities for rewritting schemaLocation
"hints" to be consistent with the file system 

=================================================================================
GME RESTRICTIONS FROM SCHEMA SPECIFICATION:
=================================================================================
* Use of "no namespace" is not allowed
* Namespaces are universally unique; they can only be reused as targetnamespaces across documents that are included together

XSD APIs:
=================================================================================
http://www.w3.org/Submission/2004/SUBM-xmlschema-api-20040309/xml-schema-api.html

# http://ws.apache.org/commons/XmlSchema/
  - doesn't seem to validate anything
  - handles imports/includes nicely
  - API is clunky
  - exception handling is poor (have to use runtimeexceptions)
# https://xsom.dev.java.net/
  - seems to validate well
  - API is nice
  - nice error handling
  - doesn't seem to give access to imports/includes in result (UPDATE: i think i could have gotten these from xsdcomponent.getSourceDocument)
# http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/schema.html (currently using)
  - claims to have 100% support... seems to be what all "validators" use
  - http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/faq-grammars.html
  - example:
     - org.globus.wsrf.tools.wsdl.WSDLPreprocessor
     - (great stuff here) http://fisheye6.cenqua.com/browse/ode/trunk/utils/src/main/java/org/apache/ode/utils/xsd
