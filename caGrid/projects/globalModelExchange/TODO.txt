NEXT STEPS:
==========

revist how annotations IVY is done... is there a better way to not have that dependency?


How to deal with redefine?  May need to not support, as if A redefines B and B is already published, uploading A would basically replace B, thus making the redefine useless (as A and B need to have the same namespace)
-- it is currently supported, but you can only redefine a SchemaDocument; it doesn't allow one to redefine an existing published namespace (which is arguably the only use case for redefine)

tests for deletes with includes (make sure the docs are cleaned up)

design how authorization/policy will work.  will i do all checking in authorization code or do i want a separate "policy interface"
for example, when i add Life Cycle States, will the authorization code check that published schemas aren't being deleted, or will that be a policy thing?

add support for lifecycle and test that "update" works

replace GME's manual synchronization with spring's transaction management ( can specify read-only, etc):
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.6/reference/transaction.html#transaction-declarative



ADMIN
(could just use grid grouper for all of these, with behind the scenes administration; 
would at least like to separate into a separate service interface
could have an authz interface that grid grouper support was hooked into)
-----
addServiceAdministrator(User)
removeServiceAdministrator(User)
User[] getServiceAdministrators()

addAdministrativeRightsToSchema(Namespace, User)
removeAdministrativeRightsToSchema(Namespace, User)
User[] getAdministratorsForSchema(Namespace)



TESTS TO WRITE:
==========
add deploy system test
  add unsuccessful deploy system test that uses wrong database information and make sure service wont start

add a test for "already defined" schema which cant be updated

add a test for schema with unused schemadocument (need to disallow)

add tests for multi-level include/import processing (e.g A includes B include C imports D includes E)

add tests which check our use of ns as the basesystemid (i.e., does new URI(ns,systemID)
  always work as the documentLocation?... our include checking requires it to currently)
  --for example, im pretty sure absolute path file includes will fail, but I think we want those to fail anyway (might just want a better message)
  --probably just need to make a constraint that includes/systemIDs need to be relative URIs 

add a test which does import of no namespace schema (need to disallow)


springize GME:
  -[done] schemapersistence
  -GMEXMLSchemaLoader
    - look into using this: http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/ServiceLocatorFactoryBean.html
  -policy?
  -something to get current identity (UserInformationProvider.getCurrentUserIdentity()?)
    

need to check use of these we need:
http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html

should be able to add a validateXMLDocument method that uses the schemaloader
 to resolve the documents schema, and then validate it
