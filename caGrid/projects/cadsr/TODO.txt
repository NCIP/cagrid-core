FUTURE WORK:

resource/context for non-blocking domainmodel generation

discovery panel should support "searching" as well

missing findSemanticMetadataForAttribute operation

caCORE BUGS:
==================================================







==================================================

(DONE -- limited until UML2XML lookup is available in caDSR) add operation annotateServiceMetadata(ServiceMetadata md) to add UMLClass information to service model

(FIXED)  caCORE provided XSD's have the wrong namespace (caCORE.cabig instead of caCORE.caBIG), I've corrected them locally... need to rectify

(WORKED AROUND) caCORE returning too many assocations

(DONE) Pull properties from preferences

(FIXED/WORKAROUND?) returning too many classes when there are package aliases

(DONE) reimplement generateDomainModel(proj,class,assoc)
  - change to association excludes

(DONE) implement generateDomainModel(proj,class)

(DONE) add appropriate service faults and internal exceptions

(DONE) add service property for setting thread pool size

(DONE) change assocations in domainmodel to be closure over exposed classes

(WORKAROUND -- made new bean ) unable to populate associations as client calls back to ApplServ even if associations are set

(FIXED WITH WORKAROUND TO GET MANUALLY BY QUERY )returning same class for association source and target

(DONE) apply association work around to caDSRServiceImpl 

(DONE) fix association rendering in UMLDiagram (its all messed up)

(DONE) generate DomainModel metadata extracts

(DONE) added association support

(DONE) make browser into introduce plugin

(DONE) need to add more context to methods for proper unambiguity

(DONE) browser needs to show project version

(DONE)until there is a public 3.1 server, this uses nci internal ones with a localhost sshtunnel
